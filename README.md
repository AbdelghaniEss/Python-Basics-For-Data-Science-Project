# Python-Basics-For-Data-Science-Project
This is the Python Basics For Data Science Project

## Overview

In this project, I utilized web scraping techniques to extract information about Tesla and GameStop stocks and revenue provided in the course material. The tasks performed include:
### Scraping stock data using the yfinance library.
### Extracting revenue data from HTML tables using the requests and beautifulsoup4 libraries.
### Analyzing and visualizing the extracted data using pandas and matplotlib.

## Installation
To run the Jupyter Notebook locally, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. All of the necessary libraries are already mentioned in the notebook.

## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook **Final Assignment.ipynb** in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab) and execute the cells to run the web scraping tasks. Make sure to update any file paths or URLs as necessary.

## Dependencies
Python 3.x
pandas
matplotlib
yfinance
requests
beautifulsoup4
